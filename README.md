# Anime Vs Cartoons
This repo is made for me to get back into coding more often and to refresh my mind. This will also be a fun test for myself as it would force me to explain each step I take until completion. The end result should be two different codes which will serve to highlight the difference between anime and cartoon and determine why one is dominating and the other might not. Of course the explanation develop will be more in depth. 

Data was obtain from kaggle.

! Despite the fact that there is data for anime there is a lack of data for cartoons. I have searched on Kaggle and Google repeatedly but nothing for cartoons. !
